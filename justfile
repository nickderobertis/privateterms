# `just bootstrap` works from a clean clone; `just check` is the full deterministic gate.
# The repo-wide verbs delegate to Nx, which fans each uniformly-named target out over the
# projects that declare it (crates/privateterms, conformance, spec, e2e/consumer); what a
# target does stays in that project's project.json. Recipes are quiet on success and
# specific on failure.

# llmlint: ignore-file[tool_output_is_signal] recipes that hand straight to cargo, clippy, cargo-deny, bun or Nx inherit those tools' diagnostics, which already name the exact problem and its fix; a wrapper message would bury them. The recipes whose failure needs project context (bootstrap, the lint-llm tier) add one explicitly.
