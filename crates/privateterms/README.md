# privateterms

The Rust SDK of the [private-terms specification](https://github.com/nickderobertis/privateterms/blob/main/spec/private-terms.md):
declare the private terms a repository, a directory or a host must never publish, then
detect, replace or reject them in text — and screen the identifiers a diagnostic would
print — exactly as the specification and its conformance suite define.

```toml
[dependencies]
privateterms = "0.1"
```

## Use

```rust
use privateterms::{resolve, Matcher, Replacement, TermMode, TermRule};

// The repository's own derived rules (derivation is the caller's), then the levels
// and the caller's replacement list.
let rules = vec![(
    TermRule { term: "quillmoss".into(), mode: TermMode::WholeWord, case_sensitive: false },
    "derived".to_owned(),
)];
let caller = [Replacement::Replace { term: "quillmoss".into(), with: "example".into() }];
let resolved = resolve(rules, &[], &caller).unwrap();

let matcher = Matcher::new(resolved, &[]).unwrap();
assert_eq!(matcher.hits("see Ｑuillmoss")[0].span, 4..15); // spans are of the original text
let replaced = matcher.replace("see quillmoss-core");
assert_eq!(replaced.text, "see example-core");
assert!(replaced.remaining.is_empty()); // non-empty would be a refusal
```

`Matcher::screen_locators` and `redact_all` give the locator outcomes of a check and of
an unavailable one; every error names the problem and never a term, and a
`DeclarationError` keeps its file in a separate `path` field that neither its `Display`
nor its `Debug` prints.

## Storage bindings (the crate's, not the specification's)

The specification defines a storage-independent model and no file format, file name or
directory layout. These bindings are **this crate's**, the ones onevcs and onetaskgraph
consume:

- **File names.** A declaration file is `private-terms.toml`, `private-terms.yaml` or
  `private-terms.yml` (`FILE_NAMES`). One directory holding two of them is refused as
  ambiguous (`DeclarationErrorKind::AmbiguousFiles`).
- **Encodings.** TOML and YAML are one encoding of the model each: `schema_version`,
  `terms`, `exceptions` and, from version 2, `replacements` (each `with = "…"` or
  `reject = true`) and `phrases`. These two documents parse to the same `Declaration`:

  ```rust
  use privateterms::{parse, Format, LevelKind};

  let toml = br#"
  schema_version = 2
  terms = ["quillmoss"]
  phrases = ["quillmoss-bridge"]

  [[replacements]]
  term = "quillmoss"
  with = "example-project"

  [[replacements]]
  term = "vantorel"
  reject = true
  "#;
  let yaml = br#"
  schema_version: 2
  terms: [quillmoss]
  phrases: [quillmoss-bridge]
  replacements:
    - term: quillmoss
      with: example-project
    - term: vantorel
      reject: true
  "#;
  assert_eq!(
      parse(toml, Format::Toml, LevelKind::Directory).unwrap(),
      parse(yaml, Format::Yaml, LevelKind::Directory).unwrap(),
  );
  ```

  `to_toml` and `to_yaml` write what `parse` reads back. YAML is read and written only
  through `serde-saphyr`, under one hardened reader: `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` stay strings,
  `<<` is an ordinary key, a duplicate key or a custom tag is refused, errors carry no
  snippet of the document, and a budget bounds nesting depth, alias expansion and size
  (1 MiB, in either encoding). A refused document is refused whole.
- **Level discovery.** `discover_levels(checkout, home, fallback)` returns, nearest
  first: the repository's own file at the checkout's root; each ancestor directory of
  the checkout up to and including `home` (for a checkout outside `home`, up to but
  excluding the filesystem root); then the `fallback` directory a host names.
  `read_dir_level` reads one directory.

## Versioning

Pre-1.0: a breaking change to the public API is a minor release. `SPEC_VERSION` names the
specification version the crate implements.
